# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
    I feel pretty good about my understanding with comparison operators. I have some past experience using comparison operators, so the material doesnt feel brand new to me.


1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
    I feel very good about my understanding with logical operators. I have some past experience with this type of operator as well, and Im am very confident in my ability to use them! 


1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
    If statements are the area I feel the least confident. I understand how they work and how they are meant to be used, it just takes me a little bit longer to think about and execute. I feel that once I have had a moment to think about how the if statement needs to be written, it comes pretty naturally.


1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
    I spent about 2 hours on this lesson, which was on par with my time estimate.


1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    I need more practice with if statements. I will be going through the lesson again, and utilizing code challenges to help me gain a better grasp on the material.
    

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    I did have a question about if statement structure. I was a little confused about the else statement at the end. I understood that it was supposed to be a catch all but I did not understand that I did not need to give the else statement parameters, but rather this is a line to execute if all other conditions are not found to be true. Kaitlyn cleared this up when reviewing my work! If I have any other questions, I will reference the lesson, utilize google, or reach out to my peers!
